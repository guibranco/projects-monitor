# Script: wait-for-healthy.sh
# Purpose: This script waits for Docker containers in a
#          Docker Compose environment to become healthy.
#          It checks the health status of services defined
#          in the Docker Compose file that has a healthcheck
#          defined, and will wait for them to reach a "healthy"
#          state before continuing. The script is useful in CI/CD
#          pipelines where it's necessary to wait for
#          services like databases and APIs to be fully ready
#          before running tests or other dependent tasks.
#
# Main Functionality:
#   1. Checks for all Docker services with health checks
#   2. Waits for each service to reach the "healthy" state
#   3. Exits if any service becomes "unhealthy" or times out
#   4. Uses a default waiting timeout (300 seconds) and a default
#      sleep interval between checks (5 seconds), which can be
#      overridden by passing arguments.
#
# Arguments:
#   - MAX_WAIT_SECONDS: Optional. Maximum wait time for health status
#                        to be achieved (default is 300 seconds).
#   - SLEEP_INTERVAL: Optional. Time between each health check (default is 5 seconds).
#
# Usage:
#   wait-for-healthy.sh [MAX_WAIT_SECONDS] [SLEEP_INTERVAL]
# Example:
#   wait-for-healthy.sh 180 3
#
